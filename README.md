# formulating-vue
Front end repo for Formulating web app.

This is a side project with the aim of learning new 
technologies in as close of a real user application as possible 
with a somewhat targeted scope.

The main new techs are Vuejs, Typescript and TailwindCSS,

The project has switched focus a couple of times throughout the 
process. It started out as a tool for my wife to use when calculating
Formulating recipes. She was not comfortable with spreadsheets and 
I was looking for a single page webapp side project to work on.

The plan was to get something up and working, brute forcing if 
necessary, to have an MVP up that could be improved upon later.
This was obviously a messy process since I was new to most of the frameworks.
I mainly worked with javaScript, Bootstrap and regular HTML in the past.

The first change of direction was to make an attempt at selling to a 
broader audience and making it into a potential Saas service. The scope widened 
dramatically in regard to both front-end and back-end. The quality of the 
newer code is therefore better structured in general as I gathered 
experience along the way, but had new things to develop, so older code 
did not get the refactoring needed.

Things changed again when we started our move to the US from Sweden and 
it became clear that we would not have the time to maintain a Saas during 
our transition even if we managed to launch it anytime soon. 
At the same time my wife took a break from formulating, so I lost my only 
Alpha Tester and "Product Owner".

This led me to switch the focus to refactoring the architecture of the application.
I'm still in the process of making the functionality more modular while 
making the app mobile friendly. I had neglected mobile friendly for too long
partly because the first draft of core functionality was quite complicated 
and I was just learning Tailwind in the first place. The other excuse 
was of course that I only had one user that exclusively used a pc.

The current focus is to improve the architecture and code quality 
of the whole app to a point where I feel comfortable using the 
project as a portfolio item reflecting my actual level of experience.
This includes adding actual tests for components, separating out 
functionality of underlying structure to data structures and services 
that make sense and making all the parts of the project easier to extend 
with the long term aspiration to go forward with the Saas launch.
